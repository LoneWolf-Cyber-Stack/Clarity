# Clarity

[cloudflarebutton]

A minimalist digital journal for capturing thoughts, quotes, and insights with a focus on a serene reading and writing experience.

Clarity is a minimalist, clean, and visually stunning digital journal application designed for a serene and distraction-free writing experience. It allows users to capture their thoughts, quotes, or insights from books they are reading. The core philosophy is 'less is more', focusing on beautiful typography, generous white space, and an intuitive user interface. The application features a two-pane layout: a sidebar for navigating between journal entries and a main content area for reading and writing. All interactions are designed to be smooth and subtle, using gentle animations to enhance the user experience without causing distraction. The application is built on Cloudflare's edge network for exceptional performance and reliability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
*   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
*   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and authenticated.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/clarity_journal.git
    cd clarity_journal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server for both the frontend and the worker, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the Vite development server for the React application and a local Wrangler server for the Hono backend, accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîß Development

The project is organized into three main directories:

*   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application code.
*   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend code running on Cloudflare Workers.
*   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types shared between the frontend and backend.

### Adding API Endpoints

1.  Define new entities in `worker/entities.ts`.
2.  Add new API routes in `worker/user-routes.ts` using the Hono framework.
3.  Update shared types in `shared/types.ts` if necessary.
4.  Consume the new endpoints from the frontend using the `src/lib/api-client.ts` helper.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed to the Cloudflare global network.

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    bun build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    ```bash
    bun deploy
    ```

This command will build the frontend assets, bundle the worker, and deploy the entire application using Wrangler.

Alternatively, deploy directly from your GitHub repository:
